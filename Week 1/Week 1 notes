HTML, JS and CSS all create a good user experience. Not just one of them. 
JS makes the page active, html defines what is shown and css is how it looks
it is important to understand the layout of HTML and how to structure the code
functions are the building blocks of JS html and css
make sure you understand when to use the correct grammar in javascript
css uses the <script> tags and usually accesses another file that the css resides in but css can also be used inside of the HTML

#result_display{
18 background-color: DarkGrey;
19 width: 300px;
20 height: 150px;
21 position: relative;
22 top: 10px;
23 left: 10px;

this code controlls the size position and color of the text box. on line 21 you can tell the box to be anywhere on the webpage

you can use named colors or a 6 digit code that is tied to that specific color

I need to study and understant looks and arays better and how they work together. 

var storedNotesString = localStorage.getItem(“all_notes”)

this will help you store the notes and information. 

there are some things that can be changed in JS but can be easier or better looking if done with CSS
